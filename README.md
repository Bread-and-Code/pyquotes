This is a API in python to get quotes.

## Plan
### Phase 1
The idea is to use scrap the quotes from [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/). We will use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for this.
To get started with this you can watch a small tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k).
Functionalities to be supported are:
* Get quotes from particular topic, categories.
* Get quotes from particular author.

### Phase 2
Convert this into a pip package.

### Phase 3
Use what we have built till now to make a twitter bot which will tweet quotes everyday.
